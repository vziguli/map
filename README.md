One of the old, but useful projects. I will update and add functionality if there is activity. Thank you!

# How to start

Use as a template and change the values to the ones you need

1. You can add any objects in ./partners/objects.js. This is a regular javascript object 
2. You can add any categories in index.html
3. Keep in mind that categories and search use "name" and "synonyms" of object
4. Also you can link to any of your object with /#id, for example: /#1

Live Demo will be later.
